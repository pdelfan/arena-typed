          'Ordinary Heartbreak\n\nBy David Levine\n\n  \n\nShe climbs easily on the box&nbsp;\n\nThat seats her above the swivel chair&nbsp;\n\nAt adult height, crosses her legs, left ankle over right,&nbsp;\n\nSmoothes the plastic apron over her lap\n\nWhile the beautician lifts her ponytail and laughs,\n\n"This is coarse as a horse\'s tail."\n\nAnd then as if that\'s all there is to say,\n\nThe woman at once whacks off and tosses&nbsp;\n\nits foot and a half into the trash.\n\n  \n\nAnd the little girl who didn\'t want her hair cut,\n\nBut long ago learned successfully how not to say\n\nWhat it is that she wants,\n\nWho, even in this minute cannot quite grasp\n\nher shock and grief,\n\nIs getting her hair cut. "For convenience," her mother put it.\n\nThe long waves gone that had been evidence at night,\n\nWhen loosened from their clasp,\n\nShe might be secretly a princess.\n\n  \n\nRather than cry out, she grips her own wrist\n\nAnd looks to her mother in the mirror.\n\nBut her mother is too polite, or too reserved, or too indifferent\n\nto defend the girl.\n\nSo the girl herself takes up indifference,\n\nWhile pain follows a channel to a hidden place\n\nAlmost unknown to her,\n\nConvinced as she is, that her own emotions are not the ones\n\nher life depends on,\n\nShe shifts her gaze from her mother\'s face\n\nBack to the haircut,\n\nSo steadily as if this short-haired child she sees was someone else.',
